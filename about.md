Originally started by TheJoCraft on January 18th, 2013, Project Redstoneworld has grown to be one of the largest and longest running minecraft projects with over a decade of history. Originally Project Redstoneworld just covered the central area (now known as Founding Island) with Ij first discovering the world in the summer of 2014. Once TheJoCraft discontinued the redstoneworld in 2016 with the release of Tower 1 in order to pursue other projects, Ij seized the opportunity, immediately taking control and getting to work on translating the world to English so that it could reach other audiences. Although he quickly realized that he wanted to do much more than just translate the world, and that's where the continuation began. Soon, Ij would apply this principle to a few other projects of TheJoCraft, and start making even more continuation projects, until 2020, when The Great Merge happened. All the continuation projects were combined into one massive world, which is still being developed with new projects of our own to this very day. 

We are open 24/7 to allow guests to check out what we've made and are currently looking for builders to help us complete our goals for a eventual world download release, join our discord for more info!
